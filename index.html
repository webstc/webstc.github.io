					"Tutoring utilizes both my acumen in academics and experience taking standardized tests.  I enjoy the process of helping teens approach intimidating subject matter and learn how to master it.  As a teenager a big part of my life was a YMCA summer camp that I attended and also worked at as a camp counselor.  My leadership skills and interest in building confidence in others originates from this experience, which has taught me how to connect with students in a fun and real way.
					</p>

					<p>
					"I meet all sorts of students.  Some are just figuring out how to pass.  Others are B students who want to get an A.  Still others are strong students who must prepare for an SAT test to get into college.
					</p>

					<p>
					"I believe that tutoring offers a unique one-on-one experience: the student receives an individual education designed specifically for him or her.  This education goes beyond the specifics of the subject matter and includes techniques of organizing, managing external pressures, and developing one's intellect and spirit in the face of high school curricula and standardized tests.  I appreciate the opportunity to help students through this challenging and often rewarding moment of their lives."

				<h4>
					SAT SUBJECt Practice Test
				</h4>

				<p>
					A great way for students to improve their scores on the SAT Subject test is to take a simulated practice test.  This means sitting a test not in a bedroom or at home, but in an unfamiliar place with no interruptions for one hour: just like the real thing.
				</p>

				<p>
					Please join a timed practice test in any subject (Math, Physics, Chem, Literature, etc) at the Founders Workspace on Sunday, October 1st.  This low-cost option is especially valuable for students who are taking the SAT Subject test on October 7th.
				</p>

				<p>
				Note: this practice test is limited to 1 hour SAT subject exams, NOT for general SAT or ACT exams.  For subjects outside of Math and Physics, students or a tutor will need to provide a copy of the exam to be used.
				</p>

				<p>
				When: 8:45am on Sunday, Oct 1st.  (Test starts promptly at 9am) <br>
				Where: Founders Workspace <br>
				553 Prospect Ave <br>
				Brooklyn, NY
				</p>

				<p>
		    	Limited to 12 students
		    	</p>

<div class="FAQ">
		<div class="container">

				<h3 id="faq"> FAQ</h3>

				<h4> When should my son or daughter start preparing for his or her subject test?  </h4>

				<p>
					I recommend he or she start two to three months before the test date.  For a May test date, start in late February.  For June, start in late March.  
				</p>

				<h4>What's a good plan for a junior who is finishing precalculus and needs to take the Math Level 2 Subject Test? 
				</h4>
				
				<p>
					Most students would do well to sign up for the test in May and June and start studying in February or March.  Alternatively, the student could take the June and (new as of 2017) August exams.  Many students, might find this to be a strain on their summer, however, and would probably be motivated to do the earlier option in order to finish in June.
				</p>

				<h4> 
				How hard is the Physics SAT Subject Test? 
				</h4>

				<p>
				Pretty hard.  Students should try a practice test and see how they do.  
				</p>

				<h4>
					How much do students usually improve on the SAT Subject Tests? 
				</h4>
				<p>
					 Much depends upon the student's study habits and motivation.  Hard-working students tend to see an average of a 100 point increase over a period of two months of study.  The point increase is rarely lower than that.  
					 </p>

				<p>
					 Occasionally a very hard-working student improves much more than 100 points.  This usually takes closer to three or four months of study and continued classwork. Students who begin already at a high level (ie, above a 650) improve on average 10% (ie, from 700 to 770).  Incremental improvements become increasingly difficult in the 700+ range.
				</p>

				<h4>
					My son or daughter isn't quite ready to take the test, but wants to sit it just to see what it's like.  Do you think that's a good idea? 
				</h4>

				<p>
					It's not a bad idea, but in my experience preparing for standardized exams has an element of sport.  I always want my students to be ready to take the exam.  I want them to be at the top of their game, so that win, lose, or draw, they feel they gave it their best shot.
				</p>

				<h4>
					What is your method for preparing students for standardized tests? 
				</h4>

				
					<p>

					Here's the process that I use:
				</p>

				<p>  
					1.) The student takes a practice exam in realistic conditions: a timed test without distractions in an unfamiliar location (NOT in the student's room).  

				</p>
				<p>
					2.) With the help of a tutor, the student reviews his or her exam systematically and pinpoints weaknesses.  This is perhaps the most difficult and humbling parts of the whole process as the student must stare into the heart of his or her mistakes and shortcomings.  
					</p>

					<p>

					3.) The student addresses these weaknesses.  He or she practices questions similar to the ones he or she missed and strengthens his or her understanding of essential subject matter.  He or she practices creative problem-solving techniques and learns strategies that address test-taking anxiety.  The student who is running out of time practices new, efficient ways of solving problems or approaching each section.

					</p>
					<p> 

					Then, the student returns to step one and takes a new  practice test in realistic, timed conditions.  Usually the cycle takes one to three weeks to complete. Repeating it several times builds confidence and improves performance.
				</p>

				
				<h4> What subject tests do you tutor? </h4>
				<p> 
				Math Level 1, Math Level 2, and Physics.
				</p>

				<h4> Do you only tutor math and physics subject tests? </h4>
				<p>
					No, I also tutor math and physics class work and the general SAT and ACT.  My specialty is math and physics, but I am also an avid reader and filmmaker with a liberal arts background and tutor the reading and writing sections of the SAT and ACT.

				</p>

				<h4> What is your rate? </h4>
				<p>
				Currently, $200/hr for in-home tutoring.  
				</p>
