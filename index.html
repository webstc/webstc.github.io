					Craig Webster is a Fulbright Scholar and Oxford-educated tutor with 15 years of experience tutoring math, physics, and SAT/ACT prep.  His students have achieved top scores and have been accepted to highly competitive schools, including Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Brown, among others.  But success looks different for each student.  For some, improving a letter grade in a difficult math class is the desired outcome.  What makes him an effective tutor is that he meets students where they are and then pushes them beyond what they think they are capable of.  Students often respond well to this dedicated and personalized approach.
				</p>

				<p>
					Currently, he tutors through Zoom supplemented with a virtual whiteboard.  He is offereing one-on-one tutoring in math, physics, and SAT/ACT.  Also, he is now offereing small-group SAT sessions.  
				</p>
				<p>
					<em>One-on-one</em> tutoring is the most direct way to cultivate a positive learning environment for your child.  I work with students on whatever they are struggling with and, throughout the process, offer regular feedback to parents.

					"I enjoy the process of helping teens approach intimidating subject matter and learn how to master it.  As a teenager a big part of my life was a YMCA summer camp that I attended and also worked at as a camp counselor.  My leadership skills and interest in helping others build confidence originates from this experience, which has taught me how to connect with students in a fun and real way.
					</p>

					<p>
					"I meet all sorts of students.  Some are just figuring out how to pass.  Others are B students who want to get an A.  Still others are strong students who must prepare for an SAT test to get into college.
					</p>

					<p>
					"Tutoring offers a unique one-on-one experience: students receive individual attention for whatever challenges they may have.  When I tutor I help students learn to organize, manage external pressures, and develop their intellect.  I appreciate the opportunity to help students through this challenging and often rewarding moment of their lives."

				<h3 id="practicetest"> SMALL-GROUP SAT SESSIONS </h3>

				
					<p>
					<em>Small-group SAT sessions </em> is a new affordable option for students who might benefit from the energy of their peers.  We will meet weekly on Zoom in groups of 3-4 students for 8 weeks before an SAT/ACT exam and cover everything students need to know: math, reading/writing, and the essay.  It's a bit of a crash course, and students will be required to do regular HW and take SAT practice tests on their own.  Hence, students will need a level of determination/independence to enroll.  We will work from two SAT books with my own worksheets and selected others sprinkled in. Price: $1,500 for an 8 week course, materials included.  Email <a href = "mailto: craigwebstertutor@gmail.com">craigwebstertutor@gmail.com</a> to sign up.

<div class="FAQ">

				<h3 id="faq"> FAQ</h3>

				<h4> When should my son or daughter start preparing for his or her subject test?  </h4>

				<p>
					I recommend he or she start two to three months before the test date.  For a May test date, start in late February.  For June, start in late March.  
				</p>

				<h4>What's a good plan for a junior who is finishing precalculus and needs to take the Math Level 2 Subject Test? 
				</h4>
				
				<p>
					Most students would do well to sign up for the test in May and June and start studying in February or March.  Alternatively, the student could take the June and August exams.  Many students might find this to be a strain on their summer:), however, and would probably be motivated to do the earlier option in order to finish in June.
				</p>

				<h4> 
				How hard is the Physics SAT Subject Test? 
				</h4>

				<p>
				Pretty hard, depending.  I've seen students struggle to get into the 600s and others score 800. Students should try a practice test and see how they do.  
				</p>

				<h4>
					How much do students usually improve on the SAT Subject Tests? 
				</h4>
				<p>
					 Much depends upon the student's study habits and motivation.  Hard-working students tend to see an average of a 100 point increase over a period of two months of study.    
					 </p>

			
				<h4>
					My son or daughter isn't quite ready to take the test, but wants to sit it just to see what it's like.  Do you think that's a good idea? 
				</h4>

				<p>
					It's not a bad idea, but in my experience preparing for standardized exams has an element of sport.  I always want my students to be at the top of their game on test day, so that win, lose, or draw, they feel they gave it their best shot.
				</p>

				<h4>
					What is your method for preparing students for standardized tests? 
				</h4>


				<p>  
					1.) The student takes a practice exam in realistic conditions: a timed test without distractions in an unfamiliar location (NOT in the student's room).  

				</p>
				<p>
					2.) The student reviews his or her exam systematically and pinpoints weaknesses.  This is perhaps the most difficult and humbling parts of the whole process as the student must stare into the heart of mistakes and shortcomings.  
					</p>

					<p>

					3.) The student addresses these weaknesses by practicing questions similar to the ones he or she missed and strengthens his or her understanding of essential subject matter.  He or she practices creative problem-solving techniques and learns strategies that address test-taking anxiety.  The student who is running out of time practices new, efficient ways of solving problems.

					</p>
					<p> 

					Then, the student returns to step one and takes a new  practice test in realistic, timed conditions.  Usually the cycle takes one to three weeks to complete. Repeating it several times builds confidence and improves performance.
				</p>

				
				<h4> What tests do you tutor? </h4>
				<p> 
				SAT 1, ACT; the Math Level 1, Math Level 2, and Physics SAT Subject tests; AP Calulus and AP Physics. I also tutor math and physics class work. 
				</p>
