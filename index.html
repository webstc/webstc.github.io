					Craig Webster provides in-home tutoring services and teaches small-group classes for high school students in the greater New York City area. He employs “skillfull means”--applying useful techniques that meet students where they are--to help them master classroom material and score at the top of their potential on SAT and ACT exams.
				</p>

				<hr width="200" align="center">

				<p>
					Craig tutors algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, AP Calculus, the Math Level 1 and 2 SAT Subject Tests, Honors Physics, the Physics SAT Subject test, and the SAT and ACT tests, including the Verbal, Reading, and Writing sections.  
					</p>
					<p>

					He divides his time between students in Westchester County, Manhattan, and Brooklyn.  
					</p>
					
					<p>
					The length of a tutoring arrangement depends upon what the student wants to achieve.  Craig has tutored students over a period of years, helping them in each of their high school math classes.  He often tutors sophomores and juniors for a period of two to four months in preparation for general SATs and subject tests.  Occasionally, he will work with a student for just a few weeks as he/she makes last minute preparations for an exam.  
				</p>
				<p>
					This spring, Craig is offering a prep class for the Math Level 2 Subject Test.  The six week class reviews all topics on the exam in a small-group setting ahead of the May and June testing dates. The class is unique in that it offers individualized homework and feedback and also includes mindfulness strategies that address test-taking anxiety.

					 Craig Webster has been tutoring and teaching for 10+ years.  He holds an M.Sc. from Oxford University and an MFA in filmmaking from University of Iowa and is a Fulbright Scholar.  He deeply cares about his students and works hard to help them succeed in every way he can.  His students have been admitted to competitive colleges and universities, including MIT, Columbia, and Tufts.

					I first began tutoring in high school and continued to teach or tutor in a variety of capacities since then.  In college, I worked for the math and physics departments helping fellow students with calculus and Intro Physics.  A few years later, I taught math to high school students in the summer Upward Bound program and over the course of four years, taught both calculus and film production at the University of Iowa.  In 2013, I began working full-time as a tutor in New York.  
				</p>
				

				<p>
					Tutoring utilizes both my acumen in academics, experience taking standardized tests, and my ability to connect with students in a fun and real way.  I enjoy the process of helping teens to overcome weaknesses and to approach subject matter that once seemed impossible.  As a teenager a big part of my life was a YMCA summer camp that I attended and also worked as a camp counselor.  My leadership skills and interest in building confidence in others originates from this experience.  
					</p>

					<p>
					I meet all sorts of students.  Some have a failing grade and their only questions is "can you help me pass?"  Others are B students who want to get an A.  Others are high school juniors who need to get a certain score on the SAT to be accepted into a choice college.  Still others are strong students in math or physics, and now must prepare for an SAT Subject test.  
					</p>

					<p>
					In each instance, I work with the whole student.  I believe that tutoring offers a unique one-on-one experience: the student an individual education designed specifically for him/her.  Though we may be working on a particular subject, students often learn and apply this to way of working to other areas.  Tutoring engages and strengthens weak areas of the student's intellect.  Students learn to stay organized and thrive amidst the many pressures of high school.  I feel very grateful to be able to work in this capacity and hope that I may be able to help you or your son or daughter.

<div class="FAQ">

				<h3 id="faq"> FAQ</h3>

				<h4> When should my son/daughter begin preparing for his/her subject test?  </h4>

				<p>
					I recommend beginning 2-3 months before the test date.  For a May test date, tutoring usually begins in late February.  For June, in late March.  
				</p>

				<h4>What's a good plan for a junior who is finishing pre-calculus and needs to take the Math 2 Sat Subject test? 
				</h4>
				
				<p>
				Most students would do well to sign up for the test in May and June.  The student should start preparing in late February or March in order to take the test in May.  If the student meets or exceeds her desired score on the May test, then she's done.  If not, she can take the test again in June.  
				</p>

				<h4> 
				How hard is the Physics SAT Subject Test? 
				</h4>

				<p>
				Pretty hard for most students.  Students should try a practice test and see how they do.  
				</p>

				<h4>
					How much do students usually improve on the SAT Subject Tests? 
				</h4>
				<p>
					 Much depends upon the student's study habits and motivation.  Hard-working students tend to see an average of a 100 point increase over a period of two months of study.  The point increase is rarely lower than that.  Occasionally a very hard-working student improves much more than 100 points.  Students who begin already at a high level (ie, above a 650) improve on average 10% (ie, from 700 to 750-770).  Incremental improvements become increasingly difficult in the 700+ range.
				</p>

				<h4>
					My son or daughter isn't quite ready to take the test, but wants to sit it just to see what it's like.  Do you think that's a good idea? 
				</h4>

				<p>
					It's not a bad idea, but in my experience preparing for standardized exams has an element of sport.  I always want my students to be ready to take the exam.  I want them to be at the top of their game, so that win, lose, or draw, they feel they gave it their best shot.
				</p>

				<h4>
					What is your method for preparing students for standardized tests? 
				</h4>

				
					<p>

					Students who ace the SATs and ACTs have a lot in common.  They are typically familiar with the exam format and the types of questions being asked.  They have mastered the subject matter underlying those questions and practice intelligent and creative multiple-choice test-taking strategies.  They know roughly how many questions they need to answer correctly to get the score they are shooting for.  This is the type of student that many who seek tutoring hope to become.
				</p>

				<p>  
					Although it is not possible for everyone to ace their exam, everyone CAN work to reach the top of their potential and improve their score.  Here's the process which I think is an efficient way to achieving this.
				</p>

				<p>  
					First, the student takes a practice exam in realistic conditions: a timed tests without distractions  in an unfamiliar location (NOT in the student's room).  Second, the student reviews the exam systematically in order to become familiar with his or her weaknesses.  This sounds easy, but is perhaps the most difficult and humbling parts of the whole process.  Nobody likes to look at their mistakes and confusion head on, but this is exactly what a student must do.  Third, the student  addresses these underlying weaknesses, including  test-taking anxieties.  Then, the student returns to step one and takes a new simulated practice test.  Repeating this cycle several times will build confidence and help the student achieve at the top of her potential on testing day.
				</p>

				
				<h4> What subject tests do you tutor? </h4>
				<p> 
				The Math Level 1 and Level 2 SAT Subject Tests and the Physics SAT Subject tests.
				</p>

				<h4> Do you only tutor math and physics? </h4>
				<p>
					No, I also tutor the general SAT and ACT.  My specialty is math and physics, but along with my math/physics background, I am an avid reader and filmmaker and enjoy tutoring the Reading/Writing sections.

				</p>

				<h4> What is your rate? </h4>
				<p>
				Currently, $200/hr for in-home tutoring.
